optoe driver

Author Don Bollinger (don@thebollingers.org)

This file describes the content of the optoe directory on the OOM github repo.
These files were prepared and submitted for inclusion in the upstream
linux kernel version 5.11.  They were not accepted for architectural
reasons.  The code correctly implements the functions it claims, but the
linux kernel network maintainers do not want user space access to network
devices, including SFP/QSFP/CMIS devices.

optoe.c is the driver proper.  It logically belongs in drivers/misc/eeprom

optoe.txt describes the device tree bindings.  It belongs in
Documentation/misc-devices/optoe.txt

optoe.rst describes the optoe driver in general.  It belongs in
Documentation/misc-devices/optoe.rst

Kconfig and Makefile add optoe support, updating the files with the same
name in drivers/misc/eeprom

I recommend reading optoe.rst first, then explore from there.
