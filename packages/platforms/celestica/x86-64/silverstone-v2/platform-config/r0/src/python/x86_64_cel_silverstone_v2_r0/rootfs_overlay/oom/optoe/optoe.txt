EEPROMs on SFP/QSFP/CMIS optoelectronic modules using SFF-8472, SFF-8676,
CMIS (Common Management Interface Spec) devices.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of : 
	'optoe,optoe1' - for QSFP class devices, adhering to SFF-8636
	'optoe,optoe2' - for SFP class devices, adhering to SFF-8472
	'optoe,optoe3' - for CMIS devices (newer QSFP class devices)
- reg: 0x50  The only valid value is 0x50, as all three standards specify that
  the device is at i2c address 0x50.  (optoe allocates an i2c dummy to access
  the data at i2c address 0x51.)

Optional property:
- port_name: can be set to any string up to 19 characters.  Note that the
  actual mapping between i2c busses and network ports is platform dependent
  and varies widely.  The 'port_name' property provides a way to associate
  specific network ports with their associated hardware ports.

Example:
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	optoe@50 {
		compatible = "optoe,optoe2";
		reg = <0x50>;
		port_name = "port1";
	};
