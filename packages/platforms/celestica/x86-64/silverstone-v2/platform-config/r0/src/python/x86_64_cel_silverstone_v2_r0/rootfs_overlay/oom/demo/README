This directory contains OOM demo scripts (or at least one so far).

gui.py is a Graphical demo of the capabilities of OOM.  It uses Tkinter,
the de-facto standard GUI for python.  Since most network switches don't
have graphical capabilities, gui.py will usually be run on a laptop or
other graphics capable device, communicating over the network with a 
switch to access the optical devices.  Here's a simple recipe:

	Install OOM on the target switch.
	   (mkdir <oom>; cd <oom>; git clone..; cd oom; setup.py install)
	From the oom/apps directory, run the OOM JSON server.
	   (cd <oom>/oom/apps; python oomjsonsvr.py)

At this point your switch is ready to provide OOM data.

	Install OOM on your graphical device.
	   (same as the switch, tweak as necessary for Windows)
	   (you will need python installed, and either git or 
	    just copy the python files from the switch to your laptop)
	Run the demo script
	   cd <oom>/oom/demo; python gui.py -url <switch IP address>

At this point the script will take a few seconds for OOM on the switch to
inventory all the optical devices, then a graphical inventory of the switch
will be presented, one row per device.  Left click on the line or lines
of interest, right click to bring up a menu of sub-demos.  Select a line
on the menu and that demo will be presented.
